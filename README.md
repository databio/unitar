# Unitar

Unitar is a simple R package that wraps the [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) package. To use unitar, you will need to already be familiar with `targets`, because the functionality is just an extension of targets and the naming conventions all follow the targets package approach. Unitar adds new functionality to use targets that span projects, which is outside the scope of the base targets package. With unitar, you can very easily link two targets projects, loading in built targets from other projects so that you can share caches and computing across users and projects.

Please see the vignette in the vignettes folder for installation and usage instructions.
